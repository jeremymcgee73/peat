**Timeline Visualization**: [Issue #118](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/peat/issues/118)

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The PEAT Protocol has a clear 12-month development pathway to achieve:
- **O(n log n) hierarchical coordination** at tactical scale (200+ nodes)
- **95%+ bandwidth reduction** through differential updates and aggregation
- **Security-ready tactical deployment** with PKI and encryption
- **AUKUS interoperability** via TAK/CoT integration
- **Path to NATO STANAG** standardization

**Critical Insight**: The project is 70% complete for research/demo with Ditto backend, but needs **EPIC 2 (P2P Mesh Intelligence)** to achieve true hierarchical coordination.

---

## 📊 Current Status

### What's Working ✅
- Core protocol phases (discovery, cell formation, hierarchical operations)
- Backend abstraction layer (can switch Ditto ↔ AutomergeIroh)
- 9 E2E tests passing (flakiness resolved as of Nov 21, 2025)
- Protobuf schema migration complete
- Network simulation with 4 topology modes
- Ditto backend: Production-ready

### What's In Progress 🚧
- AutomergeIroh backend: 70% complete (Phase 7: mDNS discovery)
- Documentation: 21 ADRs, comprehensive technical docs

### Critical Gaps ⚠️
- **P2P Mesh Intelligence** (80% of the problem Iroh doesn't solve)
- Security & Authentication (no auth currently - unacceptable for tactical)
- AI Model Capability Advertisement (customer requirement)
- QoS & Prioritization (customer requirement)
- TAK Integration (AUKUS requirement)

### Immediate Priority (Next 3 Months)

#### ⚠️ EPIC 2: P2P Mesh Intelligence Layer - **CRITICAL PATH**
**GitHub**: [#105](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/peat/issues/105)
**Priority**: P0 (Blocks Everything)
**Timeline**: 12 weeks
**Status**: 0% Complete (NEW WORK)

**What It Solves**: The 80% of P2P mesh coordination that Iroh doesn't provide:
- Peer discovery (mDNS, static config, relay)
- Geographic beacon system with geohash clustering
- Hierarchical topology management (automatic parent/child relationships)
- Selective routing and data aggregation
- Mesh healing and failover

**Detailed Tasks**:
- [#113: Discovery Strategies Implementation](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/peat/issues/113) (Weeks 1-2)
- [#114: Geographic Beacon System](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/peat/issues/114) (Weeks 3-4)

## 🔥 Critical Path Analysis

### Why EPIC 2 is the Bottleneck

**The 80/20 Rule**:
- **Iroh provides ~20%**: Point-to-point QUIC connections, multi-path networking
- **EPIC 2 provides ~80%**: Discovery, topology, routing, aggregation, healing

**Without EPIC 2**: PEAT is just an all-to-all mesh (O(n²)) - defeats the entire purpose

**With EPIC 2**: PEAT becomes true hierarchical coordination (O(n log n)) - transformational

### Dependency Chain

```
EPIC 2 (Mesh)
  ├─> EPIC 4 (AI Models) - needs hierarchical aggregation
  ├─> EPIC 5 (QoS) - needs routing layer
  ├─> EPIC 7 (Networking) - needs mesh to test
  ├─> EPIC 8 (Validation) - needs working system to validate
  └─> EPIC 6 (TAK) - needs mesh + QoS
        └─> EPIC 9 (NATO) - needs all technical work
```

**Parallelization Opportunities**:
- EPIC 1 (Backend evaluation) - different skillset
- EPIC 3 (Security) - different domain

## 💡 Strategic Insights

### On Backend Selection (EPIC 1)
**Current Approach**: Continue with Ditto for research phase, re-evaluate in 6 months

**Ditto Advantages**:
- Battle-tested (8+ years production)
- All features working today
- Known performance characteristics

**AutomergeIroh Advantages**:
- Open source (Apache-2.0/MIT) - GOTS ready
- Multi-path QUIC with connection migration
- Superior compression (90% vs 60%)
- No vendor lock-in

**Decision Trigger**: GOTS deployment timeline. If government deployment < 12 months, accelerate AutomergeIroh completion.

---

### On P2P Mesh Intelligence (EPIC 2)
**This is not "nice to have" - it's existential**

Per ADR-017: Iroh provides excellent transport, but PEAT's value proposition is **hierarchical coordination intelligence**. Without EPIC 2:
- No geographic-based squad formation
- No automatic parent/child relationships
- No hierarchical aggregation (stuck at O(n²))
- No intelligent routing or bandwidth optimization
- No mesh healing or autonomous operation during partitions

**Bottom Line**: EPIC 2 is the difference between "another mesh protocol" and "transformational military coordination system"

---

### On Parallel Backend Development
Per Codex.md: "We are not working to 'replace' Ditto. We are working to provide an alternative, pure OSS, capability that provides as close to parity as possible."

**Strategy**: Backend abstraction allows switching based on deployment:
- **Proprietary OK?** → Use Ditto (ready today)
- **GOTS required?** → Use AutomergeIroh (10-12 weeks to completion)

This de-risks both technology and licensing/procurement paths.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: EPIC 2 Underestimated
**Impact**: Every week of delay pushes entire roadmap
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Detailed 5-task breakdown with 2-3 week sprints each
- Containerlab testing at each phase
- Early prototype to validate approach

### Risk: Containerlab Scale Limitations
**Impact**: Cannot test beyond ~200 nodes
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Cloud deployment for 200+ node tests
- Mathematical modeling validated against 100-200 node empirical data
- Focus on proving O(n log n) property, not absolute node count

### Risk: mDNS Reliability in Containers
**Impact**: Discovery layer flakiness
**Probability**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Static configuration provides fallback
- Relay-based discovery works in all scenarios
- Multiple discovery strategies (hybrid approach)

### Risk: Resource Constraints
**Impact**: Insufficient engineering capacity for 12-week critical path
**Probability**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Parallelize EPIC 3 (Security) with different team
- Defer EPIC 6 (TAK) if needed (P2 priority)
- Focus 100% best engineers on EPIC 2
