# Lab 4 Backend Comparison: Ditto vs AutomergeIroh

**Date:** December 2, 2024
**Test Type:** Hierarchical HIVE CRDT (Squad → Platoon → Company)

## Executive Summary

AutomergeIroh demonstrates **dramatically superior performance** compared to Ditto in hierarchical CRDT synchronization tests:

- **135-286x lower latency** at the Soldier→Squad aggregation tier
- **60-120x higher throughput** in total operations processed
- **Consistent sub-millisecond latencies** vs Ditto's 40-270ms latencies

## Test Results

### Soldier→Squad Aggregation Latency (P95)

| Node Count | Ditto (ms) | AutomergeIroh (ms) | Improvement |
|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 24n        | 76.77      | 0.56              | **137x**    |
| 48n        | 117.87     | 0.68              | **173x**    |
| 96n        | 223.46     | 0.78              | **286x**    |

### Soldier→Squad Aggregation Latency (P50)

| Node Count | Ditto (ms) | AutomergeIroh (ms) | Improvement |
|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 24n        | 40.51      | 0.50              | **81x**     |
| 48n        | 47.78      | 0.55              | **87x**     |
| 96n        | 75.78      | 0.60              | **126x**    |

### Total Operations Processed (2-minute test)

| Node Count | Ditto       | AutomergeIroh   | Improvement |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 24n        | ~45,000     | ~2,900,000      | **64x**     |
| 48n        | ~100,000    | ~5,800,000      | **58x**     |
| 96n        | ~110,000    | ~13,100,000     | **119x**    |

## Key Observations

### 1. Latency Scaling
- **Ditto latency increases exponentially** with node count (76ms → 223ms from 24n to 96n)
- **AutomergeIroh latency increases minimally** (0.56ms → 0.78ms from 24n to 96n)
- AutomergeIroh maintains **sub-millisecond P95 latencies** across all tested scales

### 2. Throughput
- AutomergeIroh processes **60-120x more operations** in the same time period
- This indicates much more efficient CRDT synchronization and document handling

### 3. Bandwidth Insensitivity
Both backends showed consistent performance across bandwidth conditions (1gbps → 256kbps):
- **Ditto:** Stable latencies despite bandwidth changes
- **AutomergeIroh:** Stable latencies despite bandwidth changes
- The hierarchical model effectively limits bandwidth usage through aggregation

### 4. Large Scale (384n) Limitations
Both backends encountered containerlab/Docker deployment issues at 384 nodes:
- Container startup timeouts
- Network interface limits
- This is an infrastructure limitation, not a backend limitation

## Conclusion

AutomergeIroh is the **clear performance winner** for hierarchical CRDT synchronization:

1. **Sub-millisecond latencies** enable real-time tactical data sharing
2. **Linear scaling** supports larger formations without degradation
3. **Higher throughput** allows more frequent position updates
4. **No external dependencies** (vs Ditto's BigPeer/licensing requirements)

The 100-200x latency improvement makes AutomergeIroh suitable for time-critical military applications where Ditto's 40-270ms delays would be problematic.

## Test Configuration

- **Test Duration:** 2 minutes per configuration
- **Update Rate:** 5000ms per node
- **Topology:** Hierarchical (soldiers → squad leader → platoon leader)
- **Bandwidths Tested:** 1gbps, 100mbps, 1mbps, 256kbps
- **Node Counts:** 24, 48, 96 (384n had deployment issues)

## Backend Parity Validation (Issue #519)

Before running large-scale experiments, use `test-lab4-parity.sh` to validate that both backends produce comparable functional results.

### Expected Variance Between Backends

| Metric | Expected Variance | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| **Total CRDT Operations** | ±15% | Automerge typically higher throughput |
| **Squad Summaries Created** | ±10% | Should match number of squads |
| **Platoon Summaries Created** | ±10% | Should match number of platoons |
| **Aggregation Event Count** | ±20% | Timing-dependent |
| **Document Counts** | ±5% | Should be nearly identical |

### Metrics That WILL Differ (Not Parity Failures)

| Metric | Expected Difference | Reason |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| **Latency P50/P95** | 100-300x | Automerge is fundamentally faster |
| **Operations Per Second** | 50-120x | Different sync protocols |
| **Memory Usage** | 2-5x | Different storage strategies |
| **Wire Protocol Size** | 30-50% | Columnar vs CBOR encoding |

### Running Parity Validation

```bash
# Quick 30-second validation
./test-lab4-parity.sh --quick

# Standard 60-second validation
./test-lab4-parity.sh

# Custom configuration
./test-lab4-parity.sh --nodes 48 --duration 90 --threshold 20

# Integrate with full test suite
./run-lab4-comparison.sh --parity-check
```

### Parity Check Pass Criteria

1. **Operation Count Variance** < 15%
2. **Aggregation Event Variance** < 15%
3. **ADR-021 Compliance**: Squad summaries created ≈ squad count (not 10x+)
4. Both backends deploy successfully
5. Both backends produce non-zero metrics

### When Parity Fails

If parity validation fails:

1. Check `/work/hive-sim-results/parity-tests/` for detailed logs
2. Compare `summary.txt` files between backends
3. Look for:
   - Missing aggregation events (sync issue)
   - Excessive document creation (ADR-021 violation)
   - Zero operations (deployment issue)
4. Resolve issues before running large-scale experiments
