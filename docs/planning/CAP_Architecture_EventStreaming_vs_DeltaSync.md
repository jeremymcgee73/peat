# CAP Architecture: Event Streaming vs. Delta Synchronization
## A Fundamental Paradigm Shift in Distributed Autonomous Systems

## Executive Summary

The Capability Advertisement Protocol (CAP) challenges a core architectural assumption underlying most IoT and drone systems: the event streaming model with centralized data collection. Traditional systems generate a new database record for every sensor reading or state change, transmitting these events to a central repository. CAP instead leverages Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and edge synchronization to transmit only what changed (deltas), route data peer-to-peer through a mesh fabric, persist data locally during disconnection, and intelligently prioritize synchronization when connectivity exists.

This isn't merely an optimization—it's a fundamental rethinking of how distributed autonomous systems share state. The shift from "stream all events centrally" to "sync only changes peer-to-peer" enables operations at scales and in network conditions that are simply impossible with traditional architectures.

## The Traditional Paradigm: Event Streaming Architecture

### How Most IoT/Drone Systems Work Today

Current IoT infrastructures and drone systems are built on an **event-centric model**:

```
Node generates event → Timestamp + serialize → Transmit to central collector → Store in time-series DB
```

**Characteristics:**
- **Every reading is a new record**: GPS position at 1Hz = 3,600 database entries per hour per platform
- **All data flows to center**: Every node transmits to a central broker/database
- **Events are immutable**: Once written, records are never modified, only appended
- **Query by time**: "Show me all events between T1 and T2"
- **Star topology**: All data paths lead to the central collection point

### Example: Traditional Drone Data Flow

```javascript
// Every second, drone generates and transmits:
DroneEvent_T1 = {
  timestamp: "2025-10-28T14:23:01Z",
  node_id: "UAV_7",
  position: {lat: 32.1234, lon: -117.5678, alt: 500},
  fuel: 47,
  sensors: ["EO/IR", "Thermal"],
  health: "nominal",
  weapons: 2,
  temperature: 28,
  ... // 50+ fields
}

DroneEvent_T2 = {
  timestamp: "2025-10-28T14:23:02Z",
  node_id: "UAV_7",
  position: {lat: 32.1235, lon: -117.5679, alt: 500}, // Barely moved
  fuel: 47, // Hasn't changed
  sensors: ["EO/IR", "Thermal"], // Still same
  health: "nominal", // Still same
  weapons: 2, // Still same
  temperature: 28, // Still same
  ... // Transmitting redundant data
}

// Result: 2KB transmitted per second even though almost nothing changed
```

### Why This Works (At Small Scale)

For **10-20 nodes** with **good connectivity**:
- Central database provides simple query model
- Time-series analysis is straightforward
- Data warehouse tools work out-of-box
- Debugging is easy (just query events)
- Synchronization is trivial (everyone talks to center)

### Why This Fails (At Large Scale)

For **100+ nodes** with **contested networks**:

1. **Bandwidth Explosion**: N nodes × M sensors × R rate = overwhelming data volume
2. **Redundant Transmission**: 95%+ of transmitted data is unchanged state
3. **Central Bottleneck**: Single collection point becomes failure mode
4. **Network Topology**: Star topology fails when center unreachable
5. **No Offline Operation**: Nodes disconnected from center can't share data
6. **No Peer Coordination**: Node A and B can't coordinate without center
7. **Late Arrivals**: By the time data reaches center, decision window has closed

**The DIU COD experience validated this**: event-streaming architectures hit a hard wall at approximately 20 nodes on tactical networks.

## The CAP Paradigm: CRDT-Based Delta Synchronization

### Core Principle: State, Not Events

CAP inverts the traditional model. Instead of "stream events describing changes," CAP maintains "replicated state that converges through deltas."

```
Node maintains state → Detect actual changes → Transmit only deltas → Peers merge updates → Convergence
```

### Key Architectural Features

#### 1. **Delta Transmission: Only Send What Changed**

Instead of transmitting full state every update cycle, CAP uses CRDT deltas to send only the fields that actually changed.

**Traditional Event Streaming:**
```javascript
// Every update = full event
Update_1 = {timestamp: T1, node: "UAV_7", field_1: val_1, ..., field_50: val_50} // 2KB
Update_2 = {timestamp: T2, node: "UAV_7", field_1: val_1, ..., field_50: val_50} // 2KB
Update_3 = {timestamp: T3, node: "UAV_7", field_1: val_1, ..., field_50: val_50} // 2KB
// Total: 6KB for 3 updates (even if only 1 field changed)
```

**CAP Delta Sync:**
```javascript
// Initial state transmitted once
InitialState = {
  node: "UAV_7",
  fuel: 47,
  position: {lat: 32.1, lon: -117.2, alt: 500},
  sensors: ["EO/IR", "Thermal"],
  ... // All 50 fields
} // 2KB once

// Subsequent updates = only changes
Delta_1 = [
  {op: "LWW_SET", field: "fuel", value: 45, ts: T2}
] // 50 bytes

Delta_2 = [
  {op: "LWW_SET", field: "position.lat", value: 32.11, ts: T3}
] // 50 bytes

// Total: 2KB + 50B + 50B = 2.1KB vs 6KB (65% reduction)
// With 100 updates: 2KB + 5KB = 7KB vs 200KB (96.5% reduction)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Tactical networks operate at 9.6Kbps to 1Mbps
- Every byte saved is mission capability preserved
- 95% bandwidth reduction = 20x more nodes on same network

#### 2. **Peer-to-Peer Mesh: No Central Collection Point**

Traditional systems require all data flow through a central broker. CAP enables **any peer to sync with any other peer** through a distributed mesh fabric.

**Traditional Star Topology:**
```
        [Central Broker]
       /    |    |    \
      /     |    |     \
  UAV_1  UAV_2  UAV_3  UAV_4

Problem: If center unreachable, no coordination possible
```

**CAP Mesh Topology:**
```
  UAV_1 ←→ UAV_2
    ↕         ↕
  UAV_3 ←→ UAV_4

Advantage: Any peer can sync with any other peer
```

**Critical Innovation: Selective Routing**

Not all peers need all data. CAP's mesh allows nodes to:
- **Consume**: Receive and process data relevant to them
- **Route**: Forward data to others without consuming it
- **Aggregate**: Summarize data before forwarding up hierarchy
- **Filter**: Drop data outside their scope

**Example:**
```javascript
// Node A has data for Company HQ
DataPacket = {
  destination: "Company_HQ",
  origin: "Node_A",
  data: {capability_change: "strike_expended"}
}

// Node B is in-between
Node_B.receives(DataPacket)
if (DataPacket.destination != "Node_B") {
  Node_B.route_to_next_hop(DataPacket) // Don't consume, just forward
}

// Cell Leader sees packet
SquadLeader.receives(DataPacket)
if (SquadLeader.should_aggregate(DataPacket)) {
  SquadLeader.aggregate_into_cell_update() // Consume + summarize
  SquadLeader.forward_summary_to_zone() // Not original packet
}
```

This selective routing is **impossible in event streaming** where central broker sees everything.

#### 3. **Collection Model: Organizing Data for Prioritization**

CAP uses Ditto's collection model to organize data by relevance and priority, enabling intelligent synchronization decisions.

**Traditional Approach:**
- All events treated equally
- FIFO transmission queue
- No prioritization capability
- Critical updates wait behind routine data

**CAP Collection Model:**
```javascript
Collections = {
  // Priority 1: Mission-critical capability changes
  "critical_capabilities": {
    priority: 1,
    sync_immediately: true,
    examples: ["weapon_expended", "sensor_failed", "fuel_bingo"]
  },
  
  // Priority 2: Significant degradations
  "capability_degradation": {
    priority: 2,
    sync_next_window: true,
    examples: ["fuel_low", "sensor_degraded", "link_quality_poor"]
  },
  
  // Priority 3: Routine updates
  "status_updates": {
    priority: 3,
    sync_when_bandwidth: true,
    examples: ["position_update", "fuel_routine", "health_nominal"]
  },
  
  // Priority 4: Non-critical metadata
  "operational_metadata": {
    priority: 4,
    sync_bulk: true,
    examples: ["mission_counter", "telemetry_history"]
  }
}
```

**Synchronization Behavior:**
```javascript
// When connectivity limited
if (bandwidth < threshold) {
  sync_only(["critical_capabilities", "capability_degradation"])
  queue_for_later(["status_updates", "operational_metadata"])
}

// When connectivity restored
if (bandwidth > threshold) {
  // Smart catch-up
  sync_in_priority_order()
  apply_obsolescence_filter() // Drop stale position updates
  compress_bulk_data() // Aggregate routine updates
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Mission-critical updates arrive in time to affect decisions
- Routine data doesn't consume emergency bandwidth
- Network failures don't prevent critical information flow
- System gracefully degrades under bandwidth constraints

#### 4. **Offline Persistence: Local Autonomy**

Traditional event streaming requires connectivity to the central broker. If disconnected, nodes can't share data. CAP's CRDT model enables **autonomous operation during network partition**.

**Traditional System:**
```
[Node A] --X-- [Central Broker] --X-- [Node B]
       ↓                                        ↓
  Can't share data                        Can't share data
  Can't coordinate                        Can't coordinate
  Waits for reconnection                  Waits for reconnection
```

**CAP System:**
```
[Node A] --X-- [Mesh] --X-- [Node B]
       ↓                              ↓
  Persists changes locally       Persists changes locally
       ↓                              ↓
  [Reconnection occurs]
       ↓                              ↓
  Sync deltas ←→ Sync deltas
       ↓                              ↓
  Automatic convergence to consistent state
```

**Example Scenario:**

```javascript
// T0: Cell is connected
Cell_State = {
  nodes: ["UAV_1", "UAV_2", "UAV_3"],
  mission: "ISR",
  status: "executing"
}

// T1: Network partition occurs
//     UAV_1 and UAV_2 can communicate
//     UAV_3 isolated

// UAV_1 updates local state
UAV_1.local_state.update({
  fuel: 40,
  detected_targets: [Target_A]
})

// UAV_2 updates local state
UAV_2.local_state.update({
  position: new_position,
  sensor_status: "degraded"
})

// UAV_3 updates local state (isolated)
UAV_3.local_state.update({
  fuel: 35,
  detected_targets: [Target_B]
})

// All changes persisted locally in CRDT format
// No data lost despite network partition

// T2: Network heals
// UAV_3 reconnects to squad

// Automatic delta synchronization
Sync_Deltas = {
  UAV_1 → UAV_3: [fuel_update, target_detection],
  UAV_2 → UAV_3: [position_update, sensor_degradation],
  UAV_3 → UAV_1/2: [fuel_update, target_detection]
}

// CRDTs guarantee convergence
// All nodes reach consistent state
// No conflicts, no data loss
// Total bytes transmitted: ~500 bytes (just the deltas)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Contested networks = frequent partitions
- Nodes must operate autonomously during disconnection
- When reconnection occurs, must converge efficiently
- Traditional systems buffer events and replay (high bandwidth)
- CAP syncs only the net state changes (low bandwidth)

#### 5. **Smart Synchronization: Context-Aware Prioritization**

When connectivity exists, CAP intelligently decides what to sync based on:
- **Priority**: Mission-critical before routine
- **Relevance**: Cell-level before company-level for local decisions
- **Freshness**: Recent changes before historical data
- **Bandwidth**: Adapt sync rate to available capacity
- **Latency**: Time-sensitive before archival

**Example: Bandwidth-Constrained Sync**

```javascript
// Available bandwidth: 50 Kbps (very limited)
// Pending deltas: 2 MB worth

// Traditional: Try to send everything (fails)
Traditional_Approach = {
  send_all_in_FIFO_order() // Queue backs up
  old_position_updates_block_new_strike_data()
  critical_updates_arrive_too_late()
}

// CAP: Intelligent triage
CAP_Approach = {
  // Phase 1: Critical updates only
  sync(collection="critical_capabilities") // ~10KB
  
  // Phase 2: Apply obsolescence filter
  status_updates.filter(is_still_relevant) // Drop old position data
  
  // Phase 3: Compress bulk data
  historical_telemetry.compress() // 2MB → 50KB
  
  // Phase 4: Adaptive rate
  if (bandwidth_improves) {
    increase_sync_rate()
  }
}

// Result: Critical data arrives immediately
//         Routine data arrives when bandwidth permits
//         Stale data never transmitted (bandwidth saved)
```

## Architectural Implications

### Database Design

**Traditional (Event Store):**
```sql
-- Append-only event log
CREATE TABLE drone_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  node_id VARCHAR,
  event_type VARCHAR,
  payload JSONB
);

-- Query: "What's the current fuel?"
SELECT payload->>'fuel' FROM drone_events
WHERE node_id = 'UAV_7'
  AND timestamp < NOW()
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Problem: Must scan all events to find latest
-- Inefficient at scale
```

**CAP (CRDT State Store):**
```javascript
// Current state materialized view
PlatformState["UAV_7"] = {
  fuel: 45,           // Current value
  position: {...},    // Current value
  last_update: T,     // When last changed
  version_vector: {   // CRDT metadata
    UAV_7: 147,
    SquadLeader: 23
  }
}

// Query: "What's the current fuel?"
fuel = PlatformState["UAV_7"].fuel

// O(1) lookup, no scanning
```

### Network Protocol Design

**Traditional (Request/Response):**
```
Client                          Server
  |                               |
  |------ GET /drone/UAV_7 ----→ |
  |                               |
  | ←---- {full_state} --------- |
  |                               |

- Always client-initiated
- Server is source of truth
- Full state transmitted each time
- No peer-to-peer capability
```

**CAP (Sync Protocol):**
```
Peer A                          Peer B
  |                               |
  |-- What do you have? -----→   |
  |    (version vector)           |
  |                               |
  | ←- I have: [deltas] -------- |
  |                               |
  |-- Here's what I have: ---→   |
  |    [deltas]                   |
  |                               |
  Both peers now converged        

- Bidirectional sync
- No central authority
- Only deltas transmitted
- Peers coordinate directly
```

### Application Design

**Traditional (Polling/Subscription):**
```javascript
// Application polls for updates
setInterval(() => {
  fetch('/api/nodes')
    .then(data => updateUI(data))
}, 1000)

// Problems:
// - Continuous polling wastes bandwidth
// - Might miss rapid changes between polls
// - No awareness of priority
```

**CAP (Reactive State):**
```javascript
// Application observes CRDT collections
ditto.store.collection("nodes")
  .find("priority == 1") // Only critical updates
  .observe((nodes) => {
    updateUI(nodes)
  })

// Benefits:
// - Updates pushed when they occur
// - Can filter by priority/relevance
// - No polling overhead
// - Offline-first (works disconnected)
```

---

## Concrete Examples

### Example 1: Fuel State Management

**Traditional Event Streaming:**
```javascript
// Every second, transmit fuel reading
Time    Event
T=0     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 47, timestamp: T0} // 500 bytes
T=1     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 47, timestamp: T1} // 500 bytes
T=2     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 47, timestamp: T2} // 500 bytes
T=3     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 46, timestamp: T3} // 500 bytes
T=4     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 46, timestamp: T4} // 500 bytes
...
// 60 seconds = 30KB transmitted (mostly redundant)
```

**CAP Delta Sync:**
```javascript
// Initial state
T=0     {node: UAV_7, fuel: 47} // 500 bytes once

// Only send when changes
T=3     {delta: {fuel: 46}, ts: T3} // 50 bytes
T=12    {delta: {fuel: 45}, ts: T12} // 50 bytes
T=28    {delta: {fuel: 44}, ts: T28} // 50 bytes
...
// 60 seconds = 650 bytes total (95% reduction)
```

### Example 2: Cell Coordination During Network Partition

**Scenario:** 
- Cell of 5 UAVs conducting ISR
- Network partition splits cell: UAVs 1-3 connected, UAVs 4-5 isolated
- Mission continues for 10 minutes
- Network heals

**Traditional Event Streaming:**
```javascript
// During partition:
// - UAVs 1-3 can coordinate
// - UAVs 4-5 operate blind (no data sharing)
// - Central broker can't reach isolated UAVs

// After partition heals:
// - UAVs 4-5 replay 10 minutes of event logs
// - 600 events per UAV at 500B each = 600KB
// - Total: 1.2MB to synchronize
// - Must process events in temporal order
// - Takes significant time to "catch up"
```

**CAP Delta Sync:**
```javascript
// During partition:
Subgroup_A = {UAV_1, UAV_2, UAV_3} // Connected
Subgroup_B = {UAV_4, UAV_5}        // Isolated

// Both subgroups continue operating
// Both persist changes locally in CRDTs

// After partition heals:
// UAVs 4-5 sync with 1-3

// What changed in 10 minutes?
Deltas_Subgroup_A = [
  {UAV_1: {fuel: 47→42, position: moved, targets: [A,B]}},
  {UAV_2: {fuel: 45→41, sensor: degraded}},
  {UAV_3: {fuel: 50→46, position: moved}}
]

Deltas_Subgroup_B = [
  {UAV_4: {fuel: 48→43, targets: [C]}},
  {UAV_5: {fuel: 44→39, ammo: 4→2}}
]

// Total sync payload: ~2KB (99.8% reduction)
// Automatic CRDT merge resolves conflicts
// Convergence achieved in seconds
```

### Example 3: Hierarchical Capability Advertisement

**Traditional Event Streaming:**
```javascript
// Every node sends full capability set to HQ every N seconds
Node_1 → HQ: {id: 1, capabilities: [ISR, Relay], fuel: 45, ...} // 2KB
Node_2 → HQ: {id: 2, capabilities: [Strike], fuel: 38, ...}     // 2KB
Node_3 → HQ: {id: 3, capabilities: [ISR], fuel: 52, ...}        // 2KB
...
Node_1000 → HQ: {id: 1000, capabilities: [Logistics], ...}      // 2KB

// For 1000 nodes at 1Hz: 2MB/second
// HQ must process all events centrally
// No hierarchy = all data flows to top
```

**CAP Delta Sync with Hierarchical Aggregation:**
```javascript
// Node level: Only send changes
Node_1: {delta: {fuel: 45→44}} // 50B → Cell_Leader_Alpha

// Cell level: Aggregate and compress
Cell_Alpha: {
  nodes: 5,
  summary: {
    aggregate_fuel: 45min,
    capabilities: [ISR, Strike],
    status: "operational"
  }
} // 200B → Zone_Leader_1

// Zone level: Further abstraction
Zone_1: {
  cells: 4,
  readiness: "amber",
  endurance: "2hr",
  mission_capable: true
} // 100B → Company_HQ

// Company level: Mission view
Company_HQ receives: {
  zones: 5,
  overall_readiness: "green",
  mission_capability: "ISR+Strike available"
} // 50B from each platoon

// Result:
// - 1000 nodes generate ~50KB total to Company (not 2MB)
// - 40x compression through hierarchy
// - Only relevant abstractions at each level
// - HQ sees mission capabilities, not node telemetry
```

---

## Why Traditional Approaches Fail at Scale

### The Bandwidth Math

**Traditional Event Streaming (1000 nodes):**
```
Assumptions:
- 1000 platforms
- Each sends 2KB state update every 1 second
- Network bandwidth: 1 Mbps (typical tactical)

Required bandwidth: 1000 × 2KB × 8 bits = 16 Mbps
Available bandwidth: 1 Mbps
Result: 16x oversubscription → network collapse

Even at 10 second intervals:
1000 × 2KB ÷ 10s = 1.6 Mbps → still oversubscribed
```

**CAP Delta Sync (1000 nodes):**
```
Assumptions:
- 1000 platforms
- Average delta: 100B per change
- Changes occur every ~5 seconds (not every second)
- Hierarchical aggregation: 20x compression

Node to Cell: 1000 × 100B ÷ 5s = 20 KB/s
Cell to Zone: 20 KB/s ÷ 20 = 1 KB/s
Zone to Company: 1 KB/s ÷ 20 = 50 B/s

Total bandwidth usage: ~20 KB/s = 160 Kbps
Available bandwidth: 1 Mbps
Result: Only 16% utilization → room for growth

Can support 6000+ nodes on same network!
```

### The Latency Problem

**Traditional Event Streaming:**
```
Node detects target
  ↓ (100ms)
Serialize event
  ↓ (50ms)
Transmit to central broker (queue wait)
  ↓ (2000ms) ← bottleneck: 1000 nodes competing
Central broker processes
  ↓ (100ms)
Store in database
  ↓ (50ms)
Application queries
  ↓ (100ms)
Display to operator
  ↓
Total: 2.4 seconds (decision window missed)
```

**CAP Delta Sync:**
```
Node detects target (Priority 1 update)
  ↓ (100ms)
Create delta
  ↓ (10ms) ← minimal serialization
Transmit peer-to-peer (priority queue)
  ↓ (200ms) ← direct path, no queuing
Cell leader aggregates
  ↓ (50ms)
Forward to platoon
  ↓ (200ms)
Display to operator
  ↓
Total: 560ms (4x faster, decision window preserved)
```

## Implementation with Ditto Edge Sync

CAP leverages Ditto's CRDT implementation and edge sync capabilities to realize this architecture.

### Key Ditto Features CAP Utilizes

#### 1. **Automatic Delta Generation**
```javascript
// Ditto handles delta computation automatically
const node = ditto.store.collection("nodes")
  .findByID("UAV_7")

// Update state
node.update(doc => {
  doc.fuel = 45 // Changed from 47
  doc.position.lat = 32.11 // Changed slightly
  // Other fields unchanged
})

// Ditto automatically:
// - Computes minimal delta
// - Queues for sync
// - Handles conflict resolution
// Developer doesn't manually create deltas
```

#### 2. **Multi-Peer Sync**
```javascript
// Ditto supports any peer syncing with any other peer
ditto.sync.start() // Auto-discovers peers on network

// Can establish connections:
// - WiFi: Direct peer-to-peer
// - Bluetooth: Short-range mesh
// - WebSocket: Gateway to remote peers
// - Custom: Integrate with tactical radios

// No central server required
```

#### 3. **Collection-Based Organization**
```javascript
// Organize data by relevance/priority
const criticalUpdates = ditto.store
  .collection("critical_capabilities")

const routineUpdates = ditto.store
  .collection("status_updates")

// Configure sync preferences per collection
criticalUpdates.syncPreference = {
  priority: "high",
  mode: "immediate"
}

routineUpdates.syncPreference = {
  priority: "low",
  mode: "whenBandwidthAvailable"
}
```

#### 4. **Offline-First with Automatic Convergence**
```javascript
// Works fully offline
ditto.store.collection("nodes")
  .upsert({
    node_id: "UAV_7",
    fuel: 45,
    // ... updates persist locally
  })

// When network reconnects
// Ditto automatically syncs all changes
// CRDTs guarantee convergence
// No manual conflict resolution needed
```

#### 5. **Query and Observation**
```javascript
// Reactive queries update automatically
ditto.store
  .collection("nodes")
  .find("cell_id == 'Alpha' AND fuel < 30")
  .observe((nodes) => {
    // Callback fires when data changes
    // Even if change came from another peer
    alertLowFuel(nodes)
  })

// Traditional: Must poll database
// CAP: Observe and react
```

### CAP-Specific Extensions

While Ditto provides the CRDT foundation, CAP adds:

1. **Hierarchical Aggregation Rules**: Logic for cell → zone → company synthesis
2. **Priority-Based Sync Scheduling**: When to sync which collections based on mission context
3. **Capability Composition Engine**: Rules for discovering emergent capabilities
4. **Obsolescence Filtering**: Drop deltas that are no longer decision-relevant
5. **Predictive Trajectories**: Augment current state with predicted future state

## Migration Path: From Event Streaming to Delta Sync

Organizations can transition incrementally:

### Phase 1: Add Ditto Alongside Existing System
```javascript
// Continue event streaming to central DB
sendEventToDatabase(event)

// Also maintain Ditto state
ditto.store.collection("nodes").upsert(event)

// Start using Ditto for peer-to-peer coordination
// Keep database for analytics/historical queries
```

### Phase 2: Move Edge Coordination to Ditto
```javascript
// Edge nodes use Ditto exclusively
// Only send summaries to central system
squadSummary = aggregateSquadState()
sendToDatabase(squadSummary) // Much less data

// Peer-to-peer happens via Ditto
// No central broker in the loop for tactical decisions
```

### Phase 3: Full Delta Sync Architecture
```javascript
// All coordination via Ditto CRDTs
// Database becomes a subscriber to Ditto

// Real-time operations fully decentralized

## Conclusion

The shift from **event streaming** to **delta synchronization** is not merely a technical optimization—it represents a fundamental architectural choice that determines what's possible at scale.

**Event streaming optimizes for:**
- Central data warehousing
- Historical analysis
- Small-scale systems (<20 nodes)
- Reliable, high-bandwidth networks
- Query flexibility

**CAP's delta sync optimizes for:**
- Distributed coordination
- Real-time operations
- Large-scale systems (100s-1000s of nodes)
- Contested, bandwidth-limited networks
- Mission effectiveness

For autonomous systems operating in **Disconnected, Intermittent, Limited (DIL)** environments at **scale**, the choice is clear: delta synchronization via CRDTs is the only architecture that can meet mission requirements.

The DIU COD work proved traditional approaches fail at ~20 nodes. CAP, built on delta sync and hierarchical aggregation, enables operations at 1000+ nodes on the same networks. This isn't incremental improvement—it's paradigm shift that makes previously impossible missions achievable.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Event streaming** generates new records for every change → **Delta sync** transmits only what changed (95% bandwidth reduction)

2. **Central collection** creates bottlenecks and single points of failure → **Peer mesh** enables any-to-any coordination

3. **All data to all nodes** wastes bandwidth → **Selective routing** delivers data only where needed

4. **Network partition = operational halt** → **Offline persistence** enables autonomous operation

5. **Treat all data equally** misses decision windows → **Priority collections** ensure critical updates arrive in time

6. **Traditional systems fail at 20 nodes** → **CAP scales to 1000+ nodes**

This architectural shift, enabled by CRDTs and Ditto Edge Sync, is the foundation that makes CAP's hierarchical capability composition possible. Without delta sync, the bandwidth and latency requirements of hierarchical coordination would be infeasible on tactical networks.
