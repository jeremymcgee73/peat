## Context and Problem Statement

### The Hierarchy Rigidity Problem

ADR-017 established the TopologyManager architecture for hierarchical mesh coordination, but with a critical limitation: **hard-coded parent selection logic**. The `select_parent()` function (ADR-017 lines 686-709) uses fixed geographic proximity rules:

```rust
// ADR-017 approach: Hard-coded hierarchy
pub async fn select_parent(&self, beacons: &[GeographicBeacon]) -> Option<EndpointId> {
    let my_level = self.topology.read().await.my_level;
    let target_level = match my_level {
        HierarchyLevel::Platform => HierarchyLevel::Squad,
        HierarchyLevel::Squad => HierarchyLevel::Platoon,
        // ... fixed mapping
    };

    // Always select nearest node at next level up
    beacons.iter()
        .filter(|b| b.hierarchy_level == target_level)
        .min_by_key(|b| haversine_distance(&my_position, &b.position))
        .map(|b| b.endpoint_id.clone())
}
```

This rigid approach creates operational problems:

### Use Case 1: Dynamic Military Operations

**Scenario**: Squad operating in contested environment
- Static node (base station) with reliable power, high bandwidth
- Mobile nodes (UGVs/UAVs) with limited battery, variable connectivity
- Current approach: Proximity-only parent selection may choose mobile node over static
- **Problem**: Most capable node not automatically selected as squad leader

**Desired Behavior**: Capability-based election where static, high-resource nodes naturally assume leadership roles

### Use Case 2: Disaster Response Ad-Hoc Networks

**Scenario**: First responders deploying mesh network
- No pre-defined organizational structure
- Nodes have varying capabilities (vehicle repeaters vs handheld radios)
- Network topology changes as responders move
- **Problem**: Fixed hierarchy levels don't match dynamic operational reality

**Desired Behavior**: Nodes dynamically organize based on capabilities, with leadership transitioning as situation evolves

### Use Case 3: Hybrid Organizational Networks

**Scenario**: Established military unit with planned hierarchy
- Platoon leader node designated in mission planning
- Commander node fails or moves out of range
- Squad needs to autonomously promote temporary leader
- **Problem**: No mechanism for adaptive promotion when higher echelon unavailable

**Desired Behavior**: Static baseline hierarchy with controlled dynamic transitions when needed

### Same-Level Coordination Gap

ADR-017 focused exclusively on **vertical hierarchy** (parent-child relationships) but ignored **horizontal coordination**:

- **Lateral Peers**: Nodes at same hierarchy level (e.g., multiple Squad leaders under same Platoon)
- **Coordination Roles**: Who coordinates actions among peers? (Leader vs Member roles)
- **Leader Election**: How to determine which peer leads local coordination?

**Example**: Three Squad leaders under same Platoon need to coordinate fire support. Which Squad leader coordinates the deconfliction? Current architecture provides no answer.

### Architectural Requirements

1. **Pluggability**: Integrators must choose hierarchy strategy for their use case
2. **Flexibility**: Support static (organizational) AND dynamic (capability-based) assignment
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Hybrid strategies combining both approaches
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code using fixed hierarchy continues working
5. **Zero Network Overhead**: No additional messaging beyond existing beacon broadcasts
6. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same inputs produce same role assignments (testable, debuggable)

---

## Decision

**We will implement a pluggable hierarchy strategy system** that separates role assignment logic from topology management, enabling integrators to choose between static, dynamic, or hybrid hierarchy strategies based on operational needs.

### Architectural Approach

1. **HierarchyStrategy Trait**: Abstract interface for pluggable hierarchy determination
2. **Three Built-in Strategies**:
   - **StaticHierarchyStrategy**: Fixed assignments from configuration
   - **DynamicHierarchyStrategy**: Capability-based election with multi-factor scoring
   - **HybridHierarchyStrategy**: Static baseline with controlled dynamic transitions
3. **NodeRole Enum**: Leader, Member, Standalone roles for same-level coordination
4. **TopologyBuilder Integration**: Strategy plugs into existing evaluation loop
5. **Lateral Peer Tracking**: Same-level peer discovery and role management

### Design Philosophy

**Ports & Adapters Pattern**: Following the same abstraction strategy as BeaconStorage (ADR-002), we provide:
- **Port**: `HierarchyStrategy` trait (application-level abstraction)
- **Adapters**: Built-in strategy implementations for common use cases
- **Extensibility**: Integrators can implement custom strategies for specialized needs

---

## Architecture

### Core Abstraction

```rust
// File: hive-mesh/src/hierarchy/mod.rs

/// Node role within its hierarchy level
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, Default)]
pub enum NodeRole {
    /// Leader: Coordinates peers at same level
    Leader,
    /// Member: Reports to leader at same level
    Member,
    /// Standalone: No same-level coordination
    #[default]
    Standalone,
}

/// Hierarchy strategy trait for pluggable role/level assignment
///
/// Integrators implement this trait to define how nodes determine their
/// hierarchy level and role within the mesh. The protocol provides built-in
/// strategies for common use cases:
///
/// - **StaticHierarchyStrategy**: Fixed assignment from configuration
/// - **DynamicHierarchyStrategy**: Capability-based election
/// - **HybridHierarchyStrategy**: Static baseline with dynamic transitions
pub trait HierarchyStrategy: Send + Sync + std::fmt::Debug {
    /// Determine this node's hierarchy level
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `node_profile` - This node's capabilities and configuration
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The hierarchy level this node should operate at
    fn determine_level(&self, node_profile: &NodeProfile) -> HierarchyLevel;

    /// Determine this node's role within its level
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `node_profile` - This node's capabilities and configuration
    /// * `nearby_peers` - Nearby beacons from peer discovery
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The role this node should assume (Leader, Member, or Standalone)
    fn determine_role(
        &self,
        node_profile: &NodeProfile,
        nearby_peers: &[GeographicBeacon],
    ) -> NodeRole;

    /// Check if this node can transition to a different level
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `current_level` - Current hierarchy level
    /// * `new_level` - Proposed new hierarchy level
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// `true` if transition is allowed, `false` otherwise
    fn can_transition(&self, current_level: HierarchyLevel, new_level: HierarchyLevel) -> bool;
}
```

### Strategy 1: Static Hierarchy

**Use Case**: Pre-planned military operations with defined command structure

```rust
// File: hive-mesh/src/hierarchy/static_strategy.rs

/// Static hierarchy strategy with fixed assignments
///
/// This strategy uses pre-configured hierarchy level and role assignments.
/// No dynamic transitions are allowed - nodes maintain their assigned
/// position throughout operation.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Military command structures with defined org charts
/// - Infrastructure nodes with fixed roles (e.g., base stations)
/// - Testing scenarios requiring predictable topology
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let strategy = StaticHierarchyStrategy {
///     assigned_level: HierarchyLevel::Squad,
///     assigned_role: NodeRole::Leader,
/// };
/// ```
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct StaticHierarchyStrategy {
    /// Fixed hierarchy level for this node
    pub assigned_level: HierarchyLevel,

    /// Fixed role within the level
    pub assigned_role: NodeRole,
}

impl HierarchyStrategy for StaticHierarchyStrategy {
    fn determine_level(&self, _node_profile: &NodeProfile) -> HierarchyLevel {
        self.assigned_level
    }

    fn determine_role(
        &self,
        _node_profile: &NodeProfile,
        _nearby_peers: &[GeographicBeacon],
    ) -> NodeRole {
        self.assigned_role
    }

    fn can_transition(&self, _current_level: HierarchyLevel, _new_level: HierarchyLevel) -> bool {
        false // Static - no transitions allowed
    }
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Predictable, deterministic behavior
- ✅ Simple configuration
- ✅ No runtime complexity
- ❌ Cannot adapt to node failures
- ❌ Ignores node capabilities

**Complexity**: ~100 LOC
**Tests**: 3 unit tests

### Strategy 2: Dynamic Hierarchy with Capability-Based Election

**Use Case**: Ad-hoc networks, disaster response, autonomous adaptation

```rust
// File: hive-mesh/src/hierarchy/dynamic_strategy.rs

/// Election configuration weights for multi-factor scoring
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ElectionWeights {
    /// Weight for mobility preference (static nodes preferred)
    pub mobility: f64,      // Default: 0.4

    /// Weight for resource availability
    pub resources: f64,     // Default: 0.4

    /// Weight for battery level
    pub battery: f64,       // Default: 0.2
}

impl Default for ElectionWeights {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            mobility: 0.4,    // 40% weight
            resources: 0.4,   // 40% weight
            battery: 0.2,     // 20% weight
        }
    }
}

/// Election configuration for dynamic role assignment
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct ElectionConfig {
    /// Weights for leadership score calculation
    pub priority_weights: ElectionWeights,

    /// Hysteresis factor to prevent role flapping (0.0-1.0)
    /// New candidate must score this much better to trigger role change
    pub hysteresis: f64,  // Default: 0.1 (10%)
}

impl Default for ElectionConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            priority_weights: ElectionWeights::default(),
            hysteresis: 0.1, // 10% better required to change roles
        }
    }
}

/// Dynamic hierarchy strategy with capability-based election
///
/// Dynamically assigns roles based on node capabilities and resources.
/// Nodes with better capabilities (static, high resources, good battery)
/// are preferred for leadership roles.
///
/// # Election Algorithm
///
/// Leadership score calculation:
/// ```text
/// score = (mobility_score * 0.4) + (resource_score * 0.4) + (battery_score * 0.2)
///
/// Where:
/// - mobility_score: Static=1.0, SemiMobile=0.6, Mobile=0.3
/// - resource_score: (1.0 - avg(cpu_usage, mem_usage))
/// - battery_score: battery_percent / 100.0 (or 1.0 if AC powered)
///
/// Multipliers:
/// - can_parent: score *= 1.1
/// - parent_priority: score *= (1.0 + priority/255.0)
/// ```
///
/// # Hysteresis
///
/// To prevent role flapping, a new candidate must score >10% better than
/// the current leader to trigger a role change.
///
/// # Use Cases
///
/// - Ad-hoc disaster response networks
/// - Mesh network extensions without pre-planning
/// - Testing dynamic topology formation
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let strategy = DynamicHierarchyStrategy::new(
///     HierarchyLevel::Squad,
///     ElectionConfig::default(),
///     false, // Don't allow level transitions
/// );
/// ```
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct DynamicHierarchyStrategy {
    /// Base hierarchy level (can be elevated if no higher-level peers found)
    pub base_level: HierarchyLevel,

    /// Election configuration for role determination
    pub election_config: ElectionConfig,

    /// Whether to allow automatic level transitions
    pub allow_level_transitions: bool,
}

impl DynamicHierarchyStrategy {
    /// Calculate leadership score for a node profile
    ///
    /// Higher score = more suitable for leadership
    fn calculate_leadership_score(&self, profile: &NodeProfile) -> f64 {
        let weights = &self.election_config.priority_weights;
        let mut score = 0.0;

        // Mobility score: Static > SemiMobile > Mobile
        let mobility_score = match profile.mobility {
            NodeMobility::Static => 1.0,
            NodeMobility::SemiMobile => 0.6,
            NodeMobility::Mobile => 0.3,
        };
        score += mobility_score * weights.mobility;

        // Resource score: Lower utilization is better
        let cpu_score = 1.0 - (profile.resources.cpu_usage_percent as f64 / 100.0);
        let mem_score = 1.0 - (profile.resources.memory_usage_percent as f64 / 100.0);
        let resource_score = (cpu_score + mem_score) / 2.0;
        score += resource_score * weights.resources;

        // Battery score: Higher battery is better (AC powered = 1.0)
        let battery_score = profile
            .resources
            .battery_percent
            .map(|b| b as f64 / 100.0)
            .unwrap_or(1.0);
        score += battery_score * weights.battery;

        // Boost score if node explicitly configured for parenting
        if profile.can_parent {
            score *= 1.1;
        }

        // Apply parent priority multiplier (0-255 range)
        score *= 1.0 + (profile.parent_priority as f64 / 255.0);

        score
    }
}

impl HierarchyStrategy for DynamicHierarchyStrategy {
    fn determine_level(&self, _node_profile: &NodeProfile) -> HierarchyLevel {
        // For now, return base level
        // Future: Could promote to higher level if no higher-level peers found
        self.base_level
    }

    fn determine_role(
        &self,
        node_profile: &NodeProfile,
        nearby_peers: &[GeographicBeacon],
    ) -> NodeRole {
        // Filter to same-level peers
        let same_level_peers: Vec<&GeographicBeacon> = nearby_peers
            .iter()
            .filter(|b| b.hierarchy_level == self.base_level)
            .collect();

        if same_level_peers.is_empty() {
            // No peers at same level, standalone mode
            return NodeRole::Standalone;
        }

        // Calculate own leadership score
        let my_score = self.calculate_leadership_score(node_profile);

        // Calculate best peer score
        let best_peer_score = same_level_peers
            .iter()
            .map(|p| self.calculate_leadership_score_from_beacon(p))
            .max_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())
            .unwrap_or(0.0);

        // Apply hysteresis: we must be significantly better to become leader
        let threshold = best_peer_score * (1.0 + self.election_config.hysteresis);

        if my_score >= threshold {
            NodeRole::Leader
        } else {
            NodeRole::Member
        }
    }

    fn can_transition(&self, _current_level: HierarchyLevel, _new_level: HierarchyLevel) -> bool {
        self.allow_level_transitions
    }
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Adapts to node capabilities automatically
- ✅ Resilient to node failures (auto-promotion)
- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ Deterministic (same inputs → same outputs)
- ❌ More complex than static
- ❌ Requires accurate node capability reporting

**Complexity**: ~350 LOC
**Tests**: 5 unit tests + 4 E2E tests

**Key Design Insight**: The 10% hysteresis threshold prevents role flapping but requires significant capability differences. E2E tests revealed that nodes need extreme capability gaps (Static vs Mobile, high vs low resources) to reliably achieve >10% score separation. The `can_parent` (1.1x) and `parent_priority` (up to 2x) multipliers are critical for achieving this separation in realistic scenarios.

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Hierarchy

**Use Case**: Organizational structure with adaptation needs

```rust
// File: hive-mesh/src/hierarchy/hybrid_strategy.rs

/// Transition rules for hybrid strategy
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct TransitionRules {
    /// Allow promotion to higher hierarchy levels
    pub allow_promotion: bool,

    /// Allow demotion to lower hierarchy levels
    pub allow_demotion: bool,

    /// Maximum number of levels that can be promoted
    pub max_promotion_levels: u8,

    /// Maximum number of levels that can be demoted
    pub max_demotion_levels: u8,

    /// Minimum number of same-level peers required before promotion
    /// (Prevents premature promotion when isolated)
    pub min_peers_for_promotion: usize,
}

impl Default for TransitionRules {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            allow_promotion: true,
            allow_demotion: true,
            max_promotion_levels: 1,
            max_demotion_levels: 1,
            min_peers_for_promotion: 0,
        }
    }
}

- ✅ Gradual adoption path
- ✅ Tunable risk/flexibility tradeoff
- ❌ Most complex configuration

### TopologyBuilder Integration

// File: hive-mesh/src/topology/builder.rs

pub struct TopologyConfig {
    // ... existing fields ...

    /// Optional hierarchy strategy for dynamic role/level determination
    pub hierarchy_strategy: Option<Arc<dyn HierarchyStrategy>>,

**Key Design Decision**: Strategy is **optional** (`Option<Arc<dyn HierarchyStrategy>>`) to maintain backward compatibility. Existing code without a configured strategy continues using fixed hierarchy levels.

---

### Lateral Peer Tracking

**Problem**: ADR-017 only tracked vertical relationships (parent/child). Nodes at the same hierarchy level need coordination.

**Solution**: Track same-level peers and emit discovery events

```rust
// File: hive-mesh/src/topology/builder.rs

impl TopologyBuilder {
    /// Update lateral peers (same hierarchy level)
    fn update_lateral_peers(&mut self, nearby_beacons: &[GeographicBeacon]) {
        let now = Instant::now();
        let current_level = self.state.hierarchy_level;

        // Find same-level peers
        for beacon in nearby_beacons {
            if beacon.hierarchy_level == current_level && beacon.node_id != self.node_id {
                let peer_id = beacon.node_id.clone();

                // Check if new lateral peer
                if !self.state.lateral_peers.contains_key(&peer_id) {
                    self.emit_event(TopologyEvent::LateralPeerDiscovered {
                        peer_id: peer_id.clone(),
                        peer_beacon: beacon.clone(),
                    });
                }

                // Update last_seen timestamp
                self.state.lateral_peers.insert(peer_id, now);
            }
        }

        // Remove expired lateral peers
        let peer_timeout = self.config.peer_timeout;
        let expired_peers: Vec<String> = self
            .state
            .lateral_peers
            .iter()
            .filter(|(_, last_seen)| now.duration_since(**last_seen) > peer_timeout)
            .map(|(peer_id, _)| peer_id.clone())
            .collect();

        for peer_id in expired_peers {
            self.state.lateral_peers.remove(&peer_id);
            self.emit_event(TopologyEvent::LateralPeerLost {
                peer_id: peer_id.clone(),
            });
        }
    }
}
```

**New Topology Events**:
```rust
pub enum TopologyEvent {
    // ... existing events ...

    /// Same-level peer discovered
    LateralPeerDiscovered {
        peer_id: String,
        peer_beacon: GeographicBeacon,
    },

    /// Same-level peer lost (beacon expired)
    LateralPeerLost {
        peer_id: String,
    },

    /// Node role changed
    RoleChanged {
        old_role: NodeRole,
        new_role: NodeRole,
    },

    /// Hierarchy level changed
    LevelChanged {
        old_level: HierarchyLevel,
        new_level: HierarchyLevel,
    },
}
```

**Zero Network Overhead**: Lateral peer tracking uses existing beacon broadcasts (30s TTL). No additional messages required.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Static Military Organization

```rust
use hive_mesh::hierarchy::{StaticHierarchyStrategy, NodeRole};
use hive_mesh::beacon::HierarchyLevel;
use hive_mesh::topology::{TopologyBuilder, TopologyConfig};

// Mission planning: Platoon leader node
let strategy = Arc::new(StaticHierarchyStrategy {
    assigned_level: HierarchyLevel::Platoon,
    assigned_role: NodeRole::Leader,
});

let config = TopologyConfig {
    hierarchy_strategy: Some(strategy),
    ..Default::default()
};

let builder = TopologyBuilder::new(config, observer, node_id);
// Node will always be Platoon Leader, regardless of capabilities or peers
```

### Example 2: Dynamic Disaster Response

```rust
use hive_mesh::hierarchy::{DynamicHierarchyStrategy, ElectionConfig};

// First responders with varying capabilities
let strategy = Arc::new(DynamicHierarchyStrategy::new(
    HierarchyLevel::Squad,
    ElectionConfig::default(), // Use default weights and 10% hysteresis
    false, // Don't allow level transitions
));

let config = TopologyConfig {
    hierarchy_strategy: Some(strategy),
    ..Default::default()
};

let builder = TopologyBuilder::new(config, observer, node_id);
// Static base station with high resources will naturally become Leader
// Mobile handheld radios will become Members
```

### Example 3: Hybrid with Adaptive Promotion

```rust
use hive_mesh::hierarchy::{HybridHierarchyStrategy, ElectionConfig, NodeRole};

// Squad node that can promote to Platoon if no Platoon leader available
let strategy = Arc::new(HybridHierarchyStrategy::with_adaptive_promotion(
    HierarchyLevel::Squad,
    NodeRole::Member,
    ElectionConfig::default(),
));

let config = TopologyConfig {
    hierarchy_strategy: Some(strategy),
    ..Default::default()
};

let builder = TopologyBuilder::new(config, observer, node_id);
// Normally operates as Squad Member
// If no Platoon leader found and has 2+ same-level peers, can promote to Platoon
```

### Example 4: Custom Strategy for Specialized Use Case

```rust
use hive_mesh::hierarchy::{HierarchyStrategy, NodeRole};

// Custom strategy for IoT sensor network
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct IoTSensorStrategy {
    sensor_type: SensorType,
}

impl HierarchyStrategy for IoTSensorStrategy {
    fn determine_level(&self, profile: &NodeProfile) -> HierarchyLevel {
        // Gateway nodes at higher level
        if profile.capabilities.contains("gateway") {
            HierarchyLevel::Platoon
        } else {
            HierarchyLevel::Squad
        }
    }

    fn determine_role(&self, profile: &NodeProfile, peers: &[GeographicBeacon]) -> NodeRole {
        // Sensors with best signal strength become leaders
        match self.sensor_type {
            SensorType::Aggregator => NodeRole::Leader,
            SensorType::Individual => NodeRole::Member,
        }
    }

    fn can_transition(&self, _current: HierarchyLevel, _new: HierarchyLevel) -> bool {
        false // IoT nodes don't transition
    }
}
```

---

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Flexibility Without Complexity**: Integrators choose appropriate strategy for their use case without changing core topology code
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues working (strategy is optional)
3. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same inputs produce same role assignments (critical for testing/debugging)
4. **Zero Network Overhead**: Uses existing beacon broadcasts, no additional messages
5. **Testability**: Strategies are pure functions (input → output), easy to unit test
6. **Extensibility**: Custom strategies for specialized domains (IoT, vehicular networks, etc.)
7. **Gradual Adoption**: Hybrid strategies enable incremental migration from static to dynamic
8. **Resilience**: Dynamic strategies automatically adapt to node failures

### Negative

1. **Configuration Complexity**: More knobs to tune (weights, hysteresis, transition rules)
2. **Testing Burden**: More test scenarios (3 strategies × multiple configurations)
3. **Hysteresis Tuning Challenge**: 10% threshold may need adjustment based on operational data
4. **Role Flapping Risk**: Improperly tuned strategies could cause frequent role changes
5. **Learning Curve**: Integrators must understand tradeoffs between strategies

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Role flapping due to minor capability changes
**Mitigation**: 10% hysteresis threshold + configurable weights

**Risk**: Leader election split-brain (multiple nodes think they're leader)
**Mitigation**: Deterministic tiebreaking (timestamp, then node ID comparison)

**Risk**: Premature promotion when isolated
**Mitigation**: `min_peers_for_promotion` constraint in hybrid strategy

**Risk**: Configuration errors (wrong strategy for use case)
**Mitigation**: Documentation with clear use case mapping + E2E tests demonstrating each strategy

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Hard-Coded Capability Thresholds

**Approach**: Add capability thresholds to existing parent selection logic

```rust
// Rejected approach
if node.resources.cpu_cores >= 4 && node.mobility == Static {
    role = NodeRole::Leader;
} else {
    role = NodeRole::Member;
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Simple implementation
- ✅ No abstraction overhead

**Cons**:
- ❌ Not flexible (every use case needs code change)
- ❌ Hard to test different configurations
- ❌ Cannot support custom integrator logic
- ❌ Mixes topology logic with capability logic

**Verdict**: Rejected - Lacks flexibility needed for diverse operational scenarios

### Alternative 2: Centralized Leader Election

**Approach**: Higher echelon assigns roles to lower echelon nodes

```rust
// Rejected approach
impl PlatoonLeader {
    fn assign_squad_leader(&self, squad_members: Vec<NodeId>) -> NodeId {
        // Platoon leader decides which Squad node becomes leader
        squad_members.iter().max_by_key(|n| n.capabilities).unwrap()
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Clear authority model
- ✅ No split-brain risk

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires connectivity to higher echelon (not partition-tolerant)
- ❌ Single point of failure
- ❌ Higher latency (round trip to higher echelon)
- ❌ Cannot operate autonomously

**Verdict**: Rejected - Violates partition tolerance requirement for contested environments

### Alternative 3: Consensus-Based Leader Election (Raft/Paxos)

**Approach**: Use distributed consensus algorithm for leader election

**Pros**:
- ✅ Proven correctness properties
- ✅ Well-studied algorithms

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires majority quorum (not partition-tolerant)
- ❌ High latency (multiple round trips)
- ❌ Overkill for stateless role assignment
- ❌ Cannot function during network splits

**Verdict**: Rejected - Incompatible with DIL network constraints (see ADR-014 for discussion of consensus in contested environments)

### Alternative 4: Token-Based Leadership

**Approach**: Circulate "leader token" among peers

**Pros**:
- ✅ Deterministic at any moment
- ✅ No split-brain

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires token circulation messages (network overhead)
- ❌ Token loss = leadership failure
- ❌ Complex recovery from partition
- ❌ Ignores node capabilities

**Verdict**: Rejected - Violates zero network overhead requirement

---

## Decision Rationale

We chose **pluggable strategies with deterministic, stateless role assignment** because:

1. **Operational Flexibility**: Different scenarios (military ops, disaster response, IoT) need different hierarchy models
2. **Partition Tolerance**: Stateless strategies work during network splits (no coordinator needed)
3. **Zero Overhead**: Uses existing beacon broadcasts, no additional messages
4. **Testability**: Pure functions (input → output) are easy to test and debug
5. **Extensibility**: Integrators can implement custom strategies without modifying core code
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Optional strategy field preserves existing behavior

The multi-factor scoring algorithm balances three concerns:
- **Mobility** (40%): Static nodes more reliable as leaders
- **Resources** (40%): Lower CPU/memory usage = more capacity for coordination
- **Battery** (20%): Battery life matters, but less than stability and resources

The 10% hysteresis threshold prevents role flapping while still allowing adaptation when capabilities change significantly.

## Integration with Existing ADRs

### ADR-017 (P2P Mesh Management)

**Extends** TopologyManager architecture with pluggable hierarchy strategies.

**Before ADR-024**:
```rust
// Hard-coded parent selection (ADR-017 lines 686-709)
pub async fn select_parent(&self, beacons: &[GeographicBeacon]) -> Option<EndpointId> {
    let target_level = match my_level {
        HierarchyLevel::Platform => HierarchyLevel::Squad, // Fixed mapping
        // ...
    };
    beacons.iter().min_by_key(|b| distance).map(|b| b.endpoint_id) // Always nearest
}
```

**After ADR-024**:
```rust
// Strategy determines level and role, parent selection uses result
if let Some(strategy) = &self.config.hierarchy_strategy {
    let current_level = strategy.determine_level(&node_profile);
    let current_role = strategy.determine_role(&node_profile, beacons);
    // Use current_level for parent selection...
}
```

### ADR-002 (Beacon Storage)

**Reuses** same Ports & Adapters pattern for abstraction.

- ADR-002: `BeaconStorage` trait with `DittoBeaconStorage` and `InMemoryBeaconStorage` adapters
- ADR-024: `HierarchyStrategy` trait with `StaticHierarchyStrategy`, `DynamicHierarchyStrategy`, `HybridHierarchyStrategy` adapters

### ADR-009 (Bidirectional Flows)

**Complements** command dissemination with role-based coordination.

- ADR-009: Commands flow downward through hierarchy
- ADR-024: Roles determine which nodes coordinate lateral command execution

**Example**: Squad Leader (determined by DynamicHierarchyStrategy) coordinates fire support among Squad Members (ADR-009 command dissemination).

### ADR-014 (Distributed Coordination)

**Provides** role foundation for coordination primitives.

- ADR-014: Claim-based coordination for track engagement
- ADR-024: Leader role determines which node coordinates claims among lateral peers

**Example**: Multiple platforms at Squad level detect same target. Leader (from ADR-024) mediates engagement claim (from ADR-014).

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1: Adaptive Weight Tuning (Future)

**Problem**: Fixed weights (Mobility: 40%, Resources: 40%, Battery: 20%) may not be optimal for all scenarios

**Solution**: Machine learning to tune weights based on historical performance

```rust
pub struct AdaptiveElectionConfig {
    pub base_weights: ElectionWeights,
    pub learning_rate: f64,
    pub performance_metrics: PerformanceTracker,
}

impl AdaptiveElectionConfig {
    pub fn adjust_weights_from_performance(&mut self, outcomes: &[LeadershipOutcome]) {
        // Adjust weights based on which leaders succeeded/failed
        // E.g., if Mobile leaders frequently lost connectivity, increase mobility weight
    }
}
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Criteria Optimization (Future)

**Problem**: Current scoring is simple weighted sum, doesn't capture complex tradeoffs

**Solution**: Pareto optimization for multi-objective decision making

```rust
pub struct ParetoElectionStrategy {
    pub objectives: Vec<Objective>, // Minimize latency, maximize uptime, etc.
    pub constraints: Vec<Constraint>, // Battery > 20%, CPU < 80%, etc.
}
```

### Phase 3: Time-Aware Role Transitions (Future)

**Problem**: Hysteresis prevents flapping but doesn't consider time dimension

**Solution**: Add temporal constraints to role transitions

```rust
pub struct TemporalElectionConfig {
    pub min_leader_tenure: Duration, // Minimum time as leader before demotion
    pub grace_period: Duration,      // Time to recover capability before demotion
}
```

### Phase 4: Hierarchical Level Promotion (Future)

**Problem**: Current implementation always returns `base_level`, doesn't implement adaptive promotion

**Solution**: Implement level promotion logic in strategies

```rust
impl DynamicHierarchyStrategy {
    fn should_promote_to_higher_level(&self, nearby_beacons: &[GeographicBeacon]) -> bool {
        // If no higher-level peers found and we have sufficient same-level peers
        let higher_level = self.base_level.parent();
        let has_higher_peers = nearby_beacons.iter().any(|b| b.hierarchy_level == higher_level);

        if !has_higher_peers && self.sufficient_peers_for_promotion(nearby_beacons) {
            return true;
        }
        false
    }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (27 tests - All Passing)

**Static Strategy** (3 tests):
- ✅ Returns assigned level regardless of capabilities
- ✅ Returns assigned role regardless of peers
- ✅ Disallows all transitions

**Dynamic Strategy** (5 tests):
- ✅ Leadership score prefers high capability nodes
- ✅ Standalone role when no same-level peers
- ✅ Leader role with high capability vs low capability peers
- ✅ Level transitions allowed when configured
- ✅ Level transitions disabled when configured

**Hybrid Strategy** (9 tests):
- ✅ Returns baseline level
- ✅ Uses baseline role when no peers
- ✅ Uses dynamic role election with peers present
- ✅ Static level + dynamic role constructor
- ✅ Adaptive promotion constructor configuration
- ✅ Promotion allowed within limits
- ✅ Demotion allowed within limits
- ✅ No transitions when disabled
- ✅ Same-level transition always allowed

**TopologyBuilder Integration** (10 existing tests continue passing):
- ✅ Backward compatibility (no strategy configured)
- ✅ Strategy determines level
- ✅ Strategy determines role
- ✅ Events emitted on level/role changes

### End-to-End Tests (8 tests - All Passing)

**test_dynamic_hierarchy_election_with_three_nodes**:
- 3 nodes with different capabilities (Static, SemiMobile, Mobile)
- Validates Static node becomes Leader
- Validates SemiMobile and Mobile become Members

**test_multi_node_role_convergence**:
- 5 nodes with extreme capability differences
- Validates exactly 1 Leader election
- Validates 4 Members
- Tests hysteresis effectiveness

**test_role_transition_when_leader_leaves**:
- Leader node leaves network
- Validates next-best node promoted to Leader
- Validates role stability after transition

**test_lateral_peer_discovery**:
- Multiple nodes at same hierarchy level
- Validates lateral peer tracking
- Validates LateralPeerDiscovered events

**test_hybrid_strategy_static_level_dynamic_role**:
- Fixed hierarchy level (Squad)
- Dynamic role election among peers
- Validates role assignment without level changes

**test_hybrid_strategy_adaptive_promotion**:
- Baseline Squad level
- Validates promotion constraints
- Validates min_peers_for_promotion enforcement

**test_static_hierarchy_fixed_roles**:
- Static role assignment
- Validates role never changes regardless of capabilities/peers

**test_role_stability_with_hysteresis**:
- Nodes with similar capabilities
- Validates 10% hysteresis prevents flapping
- Tests minor capability changes don't trigger role changes

### Key Testing Insights

**Hysteresis Calibration**: E2E tests revealed that 10% hysteresis requires extreme capability differences for reliable Leader election. Nodes with similar capabilities won't achieve >10% score separation without aggressive multipliers (`can_parent=1.1x`, `parent_priority=up to 2x`).

**Deterministic Behavior**: All tests are deterministic (same inputs → same outputs). This is critical for debugging and operational predictability.

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Computational Complexity

**Leadership Score Calculation**: O(1)
- Fixed number of weighted factors
- No iteration over data structures

**Role Determination**: O(n) where n = number of nearby beacons
- Single pass to filter same-level peers
- Single pass to find max peer score
- Comparison and role assignment

**Lateral Peer Tracking**: O(n) where n = number of nearby beacons
- Single pass to identify same-level peers
- HashMap insertion/update: O(1) average
- Expiration check: O(m) where m = number of tracked lateral peers

### Memory Overhead

**Per-Node State**:
- `hierarchy_strategy`: 8 bytes (Arc pointer)
- `role`: 1 byte (enum)
- `lateral_peers`: ~48 bytes (HashMap) + 40 bytes per tracked peer
- Total: ~56 bytes + (40 × lateral_peer_count)

**Strategy Instance**:
- StaticHierarchyStrategy: 2 bytes (level + role enums)
- DynamicHierarchyStrategy: 32 bytes (config + base_level + bool)
- HybridHierarchyStrategy: 48 bytes (baseline + config + transition_rules)

**Negligible Impact**: Strategy overhead is <100 bytes per node, insignificant compared to beacon broadcast payloads (~500 bytes each).

### Network Overhead

**Zero Additional Messages**: Lateral peer tracking and role determination use existing beacon broadcasts (30s TTL from ADR-017). No new network traffic introduced.

## Operational Guidance

### Choosing a Strategy

| Scenario | Recommended Strategy | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| Pre-planned military operation with defined org chart | **Static** | Predictable, matches command structure |
| Disaster response with ad-hoc team formation | **Dynamic** | Automatically adapts to available resources |
| Established unit with occasional failures | **Hybrid (static level, dynamic role)** | Maintains structure, adapts to failures |
| Autonomous squad operations | **Hybrid (adaptive promotion)** | Can promote to higher level when needed |
| IoT sensor network | **Custom** (extend HierarchyStrategy) | Domain-specific logic for sensor aggregation |
| Testing/validation | **Static** | Deterministic, repeatable behavior |

### Configuration Guidelines

**Dynamic Strategy Weights**:
- **High mobility networks** (vehicular, aerial): Increase `mobility` weight (0.5-0.6)
- **Resource-constrained devices** (IoT, embedded): Increase `resources` weight (0.5-0.6)
- **Battery-powered operations**: Increase `battery` weight (0.3-0.4)
- **Balanced operations**: Use defaults (0.4, 0.4, 0.2)

**Hysteresis Tuning**:
- **Stable operations**: 15-20% (prevents flapping, slower adaptation)
- **Dynamic operations**: 5-10% (faster adaptation, slight flapping risk)
- **Default**: 10% (tested in E2E scenarios)

**Transition Rules (Hybrid)**:
- **Conservative**: Only dynamic role, no level transitions
- **Adaptive**: Allow 1-level promotion with min 2 peers
- **Aggressive**: Allow multi-level transitions (use with caution)

## Appendix A: Election Algorithm Mathematics

### Score Calculation Formula

```
base_score = (mobility_score × W_mobility) + (resource_score × W_resources) + (battery_score × W_battery)

final_score = base_score × multiplier_can_parent × multiplier_priority

Where:
  W_mobility = 0.4      (40% weight)
  W_resources = 0.4     (40% weight)
  W_battery = 0.2       (20% weight)

  mobility_score ∈ {1.0, 0.6, 0.3}  (Static, SemiMobile, Mobile)
  resource_score ∈ [0.0, 1.0]       (1.0 - avg(cpu_usage, mem_usage))
  battery_score ∈ [0.0, 1.0]        (battery_percent / 100.0, or 1.0 if AC)

  multiplier_can_parent = 1.1 if can_parent else 1.0
  multiplier_priority = 1.0 + (parent_priority / 255.0)  // priority ∈ [0, 255]
```

### Leader Determination with Hysteresis

```
threshold = best_peer_score × (1.0 + hysteresis)

role = if my_score ≥ threshold then Leader else Member

Where:
  hysteresis = 0.1 (default)  // 10% better required
```

### Example Calculation

**Node A** (Static, 20% CPU, 30% memory, AC powered, can_parent=true, priority=200):
```
mobility_score = 1.0
resource_score = 1.0 - ((20 + 30) / 2 / 100) = 1.0 - 0.25 = 0.75
battery_score = 1.0 (AC powered)

base_score = (1.0 × 0.4) + (0.75 × 0.4) + (1.0 × 0.2) = 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.9

final_score = 0.9 × 1.1 × (1.0 + 200/255) = 0.9 × 1.1 × 1.784 = 1.77
```

**Node B** (Mobile, 70% CPU, 80% memory, 30% battery, can_parent=false, priority=50):
```
mobility_score = 0.3
resource_score = 1.0 - ((70 + 80) / 2 / 100) = 1.0 - 0.75 = 0.25
battery_score = 0.3

base_score = (0.3 × 0.4) + (0.25 × 0.4) + (0.3 × 0.2) = 0.12 + 0.1 + 0.06 = 0.28

final_score = 0.28 × 1.0 × (1.0 + 50/255) = 0.28 × 1.196 = 0.33
```

**Result**: Node A score (1.77) is 5.36× higher than Node B (0.33), easily exceeding 10% hysteresis threshold. Node A becomes Leader, Node B becomes Member.

### From Hard-Coded Hierarchy (ADR-017) to Flexible Strategies (ADR-024)

**Before (ADR-017 approach)**:
```rust
let config = TopologyConfig {
    node_id: "platform-1".to_string(),
    hierarchy_level: HierarchyLevel::Platform, // Fixed
    // ...
};

let builder = TopologyBuilder::new(config, observer);
// Node always operates at Platform level
// Parent selection based only on proximity
```

**After (ADR-024 - Backward Compatible)**:
```rust
// Option 1: No change needed - backward compatible
let config = TopologyConfig {
    node_id: "platform-1".to_string(),
    hierarchy_level: HierarchyLevel::Platform,
    hierarchy_strategy: None, // Uses fixed hierarchy_level
    // ...
};

// Option 2: Add dynamic strategy
let strategy = Arc::new(DynamicHierarchyStrategy::new(
    HierarchyLevel::Platform,
    ElectionConfig::default(),
    false,
));

let config = TopologyConfig {
    node_id: "platform-1".to_string(),
    hierarchy_level: HierarchyLevel::Platform, // Still used as fallback
    hierarchy_strategy: Some(strategy), // Overrides fixed level/role
    // ...
};
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. Identify use case (military, disaster response, IoT, etc.)
2. Choose appropriate strategy (Static, Dynamic, Hybrid)
3. Configure strategy parameters (weights, hysteresis, transition rules)
4. Add to TopologyConfig
5. Test with E2E scenarios
6. Monitor role changes in production (RoleChanged events)
7. Tune parameters based on operational data
